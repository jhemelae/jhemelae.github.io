I am currently a postdoc at University of Antwerp (FWO) in the research group [Fundamental Mathematics](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/fundamental-mathematics/), studying topos theory and its applications to concrete problems in number theory, algebra or (noncommutative) geometry.

My PhD thesis "Topos-theoretic methods in noncommutative geometry" (2019, pdf [here](thesis-jens-hemelaer.pdf)) was written under supervision of [Lieven Le Bruyn](http://matrix.uantwerpen.be/lieven.lebruyn/).
