From 2015 to 2023, I was a mathematics PhD student and then researcher, at University of Antwerp. My PhD thesis "Topos-theoretic methods in noncommutative geometry" (2019, pdf [here](thesis-jens-hemelaer.pdf)) was written under supervision of [Lieven Le Bruyn](http://matrix.uantwerpen.be/lieven.lebruyn/).

Now, I work at [Antea Group Belgium](https://anteagroup.be/), where I am part of the Data Driven Solutions team, building Python software in the area of water monitoring and water management. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jhemelae) here.
